										<h1>Project Idea</h1>
									</header>

									

									<p>Overview: The aim of this project will be to create an interactive game application that will promote confidence and social skills in children aged 4-6 years of age who are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>
									<p>Motivation: This project will be useful as, according to Autism Spectrum Australia, based on findings in 2018, 1 in 70 people in Australia are on the Autism Spectrum which equates to around 353,880 people (Autism Spectrum Australia 2018). While doing some deeper research into this idea I came across an article written by Kristie Brown Lofland who wrote that many people with ASD are visual thinkers and that some individuals may have auditory sensitivity and are better able to respond to lower sounds. Computers can be used to download appropriate voice levels and adjust sound. (Loftland n.d.)</p>
									<p>Having worked in the childcare industry for 10 years, I have had children 4-6 years with ASD in my care, and I believe that an interactive application comprising of games such hidden object, word association and simple puzzles will greatly improve their confidence as well as their social skills.</p>
                                    <p>Description: The features of this product will include brightly coloured graphics that are designed in a simple, yet clear way as to stimulate the child’s visual senses. There will be audio files attached to the games with simple phrases such as “The cat goes in the….” or “can you find the…?” that will be recorded in an appropriate tone that can be adjusted by the child’s parent, guardian or teacher. The application will have a touch screen interface to promote ease of use for the child, and as the child will be able move objects around and explore interactive areas to find hidden objects. The touch screen interface will also provide visual stimulation for the child. There will be at least 5 levels of difficulty for each age group so the child has an opportunity to progress, thus achieving a sense of accomplishment and a feeling of confidence.</p>
									<p>The application will be designed so that the child will have the opportunity for social interactions with other children of their age as well as their parents, teachers or guardians through the use of verbal prompts, so when the program asks the child to find a certain object, or ask the child to match an object, the child can respond verbally.  The puzzle game will come in a two player capacity, as well as singular so that the child can have the opportunity to collaborate and verbally interact with a partner if they so choose. The puzzles will start out as simple sliding blocks that will fit together to form a picture of an animal or nature scene etc. and will change in varying degrees of difficulty as the child progresses as well as taking into account the child’s age group. </p>
									<p>The hidden object game will comprise of a colourful background such as a farm yard scene, nature scene, beach scene and shop scene and will have up to 15 different hidden objects that the children will have to search for, depending on the level of the game and age range of the child. This will give the child the opportunity to engage with their parents, guardian, teacher or other children in their peer group by encouraging the child to seek help looking for the objects, or encourage the child to share their achievements with others when they find the object themselves.</p>
									<p>The word association game will comprise of a picture of an animal or object and a text line that says ‘This is a …’ there will be several drag and drop word options for the child to choose from, for example there might be a picture of a dog, the text line, and word options such as ‘dog’,’ frog’, ‘log’ etc. the child will then have to choose the word that best suits the picture. This will allow the child to develop language skills as well as communication skills through sharing their accomplishments with their parents, guardians, teacher or other children in their peer group. The app will also include a ‘save’ function so that the child can save their progress.</p>
									<p>Tools and Technologies: This Project will need tools such as Unity, Unreal Engine 4 or Cocos2D to develop it. Out of these three tools, only Cocos2D is open source.</p>
									<p>Skills Required: The Skills required for this project include:</p>
									<p>•	A knowledge of Mobile Interface Design: This would involve understanding that the components of the application should be where the user is likely to expect them, making good use of a unified colour scheme, making sure that the loading and operation of the application is fast, including general help and basic tips in the application and including activity indicators in the application.</p>
									<p>•	Knowledge of Cross-platform App Development: This would involve having knowledge of the platforms available in the current industry. For application design, these platforms include Android, iPhone and Windows Phones.</p>
									<p>•	Back end computing: This would involve making sure that the application has adequate security, that the application has hardware interaction, implementation of memory allocation and database management.</p>
									<p>•	Modern Language Programming Skills: This would involve having experience with Programming languages such as Java and C#, being trained in web development languages such as HTML 5 and CSS as well as being being familiar with API’s such as Apple iOS, Android and Windows mobile.</p>
									<p>•	Business capability: This would involve having good business skills and marketing capabilities.</p>
									<p>At this present time, it is not that feasible for me to find the to find the necessary skills as I am completely new to the field, hopefully in time this will change as my own skills develop and I will be able to network, sourcing people who have the skills I need but do not yet have. It will, however be fairly feasible to source the software needed as most, if not all of the software needed is free to use. At this present time while I have done a lot of research about hardware needed for app development, I still do not understand completely what exact  type is needed in developing a gaming app apart from a computer with a good graphics card.</p>
									<p>Outcome: If this project is successful, hopefully the outcome will be that children with ASD will have a fun, educational game app that will help them develop the skills that they need. The original problem will be solved as children with ASD will develop key skills such as communication and confidence. The impact that this development will have on children and families living with ASD will be that parents, guardians and teachers will be able to offer children who have ASD a tool to help them learn and grow.</p>
