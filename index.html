										<p>Name: Katherine Hallam</p>
										<p>Student Number: s3775575</p>
										<p>Email: s3775575@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
										<p>Originally from the UK, my family and I moved to Perth, Western Australia when I was five years old because we needed a change, apparently. As far as education goes I have a Diploma in Beauty Therapy and a Diploma in Childhood Education, as well as a few Cert Three’s in other subjects. My main spoken language is English although I can speak (very) basic Italian. One of my hobbies includes horse riding; I actually used to own my own horse as well as a pony but due to some unfortunate circumstances I had to sell them. Another of my hobbies includes writing poetry and I have had some of my poems published in a few publications. I also have a miniature Schnauzer called Scooter, who I enjoy taking for walks.</p>

												<p>At the moment, my interest in IT includes Web Design although I do have an interest in game development and design. I suppose my  interest in IT started when I was given a ‘Speak and Spell’ for Christmas 1991, I remember that I was fascinated with how this toy could help me  progress with my spelling and I was intrigued with the way that this toy worked (e.g. how did it know that I spelt a word incorrectly? How did it talk?) Therefore, I wanted to know everything about it.</p>

												<p>If there had to be a person who sparked my interest for IT, it would have been my late Father, who always had an ongoing passion for computers and computer software, and until his death in 2013 worked as a desktop publisher. Unfortunately my experience in IT is quite limited, apart for some basic HTML knowledge learnt in High school, and some knowledge of desktop publishing gained when I worked with my Father for a while, I am a total novice</p>
												<p>I chose to study Information Technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology through Open Universities Australia, because as I have stated in the previous paragraphs I have always had an interest in IT, however it wasn’t until recently that I thought about seriously studying, or pursuing IT as a career path. I had looked at a few different Universities and weighed up the pros and cons of studying online versus studying on campus, and after careful consideration I decided that the course delivered through RMIT best suited my needs.</p>
												<p>During my studies I expect to learn the basic fundamentals of Information Technology and concepts such as web design, programming, coding, app design etc. Basically I want to gain enough knowledge and confidence to be able to apply my skills to whatever project I am working on. So, for example if I were to become a web designer I would want to know how to use HTML and CSS in the correct way to achieve the best possible results.</p>

											<p></p>
											<p>The position that best fits my ideal job is that of a project manager in the gaming industry. This job requires that the interested candidate has a solid interest in online gaming and a passion for MMO, video or free to play games. This position is appealing to me because I am extremely interested in video games and online games and enjoy playing them in my spare time. </p>
											<p>The skills, qualifications and experience that I will need for this job include; having a software Engineering background, three years’ experience as a project manager, solid experience working in software technology, a strong understanding of technology and development, experience working in an Agile environment, exceptional communication skills as well as a cool, calm and collected attitude. At this current time, I do not possess any of the skills, qualifications or experience needed for this job. </p>
											<p>I will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience needed for my ideal job by:
<p>•	Gaining a Bachelor’s Degree in software Engineering (which is a 4 year degree).</p>
<p>•	After graduating (Batchelor of Information Technology), I will gain enough experience in the IT field (through employment) that is related to project management, then I will hopefully be able to advance in my career and become a full project manager. Realistically this will take roughly 6-8 years (3-5 years gaining experience to become a project manager, then 3 years as a full project manager as stated in the job description</p>
<p>•	I will gain experience working in software technology through employment and through my time as a student studying software engineering.</p>
<p>•	 I will gain a strong understanding of Technology and Development through employment in the IT field.</p>
<p>•	I will gain experience working in an agile environment through employment.</p>
<p>•	I will work on my communication skills by working collaboratively with students during my studies and with my co-workers when I gain employment</p>.

											<p>For me, the results of these tests mean that I am an introvert who tends to drift off into their own world at times, which I guess is true. It also means that because of my introverted nature, I may experience difficulty communicating with people at times, and may find certain situations stressful. I was surprised at the results of the learning style test though, as I’ve always considered myself a visual learner, not an auditory learner…..and yes, I answered the questions in the test as honestly as I could! I think that these results may influence my behaviour in a team somewhat negatively, as my personality is introverted I may have trouble establishing connections with my team members, I may also experience difficulties in communicating with my team members. I should take these results into account when forming a team by realising that by being introverted, and having some difficulties in communicating, I may find it hard fitting into a team environment at times.</p>
